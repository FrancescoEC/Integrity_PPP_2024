Installation Instructions

The Constellation Toolbox is normally contained on a CD or zipped file. Other formats are available upon 
request. This toolbox works with MATLAB version 5.0 or greater.

For PC users, the Toolbox is distributed as a standard Windows install program.  Run the set-up program on the disk and 
follow the on-screen instructions.  The resulting directory structure after installation will be:

	...\constell		- contains almost all toolbox functions 
	...\constell\demo	- contains the GUI-based demo 
	...\constell\tutorial	- contains the tutorial code 

Unix users will be provided a floppy disk with the Toolbox stored as a tar file.  Mac users will be supplied the raw script 
files on a floppy disk with the directory structure described above. 

For Unix and Mac users, the directory structure described above should be created and the files copied into the appropriate 
directory from the installation disk.

Documentation is provided as Adobe Acrobat and on-line MATLAB help.  To download Adobe Acrobat Reader, go to 
http://www.adobe.com.

Add the toolbox directory to your MATLAB path.  The toolbox is accessible from all directories when on your MATLAB path.
Use the graphical path editing tool available in the base MATLAB environment to add the constell directory (using the 
example above) to your path.  We recommend you adding the main toolbox directory to the back of your MATLAB path. 
                    OR
Edit the pathdef.m file.  For normal installations, this file is found in the ..\matlab5x\toolbox\local directory.


Your Constellation Toolbox installation is now complete.
