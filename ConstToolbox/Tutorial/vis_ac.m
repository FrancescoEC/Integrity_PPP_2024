% Function to demonstrate body-fixed masking and Earth obscuring functions
% for an aircraft trajectory.
%
% An aircraft is modeled with an initial location at ECEF = (6378e3,0,0).  It
% has a ground speed of 200 m/s (450 mph).  The aircraft flies straight and
% level North for 60 sec, then banks to the right by 45 deg and executes a
% 360 deg. turn at constant altitude (about 128 sec).  At the end of the turn,
% the airplane levels back out and continues to fly North, straight and level, 
% until 300 secs have elapsed since the beginning of the flight.  Aircraft
% position, velocity, and attitude data are stored in a file at 1 sec intervals.
% This data is read in and used in this example.
%
% A GPS antenna is mounted to the top of the airplane.  It is masked by the
% fuselage (elevation < 0) and by the vertical tail (elevation < 30 deg for
% an azimuth range of 170 to 190 deg, relative to the nose of the airplane).
% A 5 deg mask of the Earth is also used.

% Compute LOS vectors from airplane to GPS satellites, in ECEF. The los_ind
